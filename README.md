# 🚦 City Congestion Prediction & Mitigation Platform

A full-stack, machine-learning–driven system designed to **predict short-term urban traffic congestion and actively reduce it** using data-driven decision mechanisms such as adaptive signal control and proactive routing.

This project goes **beyond traffic visualization** by integrating **prediction, optimization, and simulation** into a deployable architecture.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion leads to:
- Increased travel time
- Fuel wastage and higher emissions
- Delayed emergency response
- Economic inefficiency

Most existing solutions are **reactive**.  
This platform is **predictive and prescriptive**.

---

## 🎯 System Capabilities

1. Predicts congestion **15–30 minutes ahead**
2. Identifies probable congestion causes
3. Applies mitigation strategies (signal optimization / rerouting)
4. Simulates impact before deployment
5. Visualizes live and future traffic conditions
